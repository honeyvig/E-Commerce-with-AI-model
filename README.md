# E-Commerce-with-AI-model
Building an e-commerce platform integrated with an AI/ML model to analyze customer behavior is an exciting project! Below is a simplified Python framework to get you started. This example will cover the basic structure of an e-commerce site using Flask, a lightweight web framework, and outline how to incorporate an AI model to analyze user behavior and recommend products.
Step 1: Setup Your Environment

Make sure you have Flask and other necessary libraries installed:

bash

pip install Flask pandas scikit-learn

Step 2: Build the Basic E-commerce Platform

Hereâ€™s a basic outline of how your Flask app might look:

python

from flask import Flask, render_template, request, redirect, url_for
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.neighbors import NearestNeighbors

app = Flask(__name__)

# Sample data (replace with your product data)
products = pd.DataFrame({
    'product_id': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
    'name': ['Dress', 'Shoes', 'Hat', 'T-Shirt', 'Pants'],
    'features': [[1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1], [1, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0]]  # Dummy feature vectors
})

# User behavior data (replace with real tracking data)
user_behavior = pd.DataFrame(columns=['user_id', 'product_id'])

@app.route('/')
def home():
    return render_template('home.html', products=products)

@app.route('/product/<int:product_id>')
def product(product_id):
    # Record user behavior
    user_id = 1  # This should be the actual user ID in a real application
    global user_behavior
    user_behavior = user_behavior.append({'user_id': user_id, 'product_id': product_id}, ignore_index=True)
    return render_template('product.html', product=products[products['product_id'] == product_id].iloc[0])

@app.route('/recommendations')
def recommendations():
    # Simple recommendation logic
    user_id = 1  # Replace with actual user ID
    viewed_products = user_behavior[user_behavior['user_id'] == user_id]['product_id'].tolist()
    
    # Find similar products
    if viewed_products:
        product_features = products[products['product_id'].isin(viewed_products)]['features'].tolist()
        model = NearestNeighbors(metric='cosine')
        model.fit(products['features'].tolist())
        
        recommendations = model.kneighbors(product_features, n_neighbors=3)[1][0]
        recommended_products = products.iloc[recommendations].to_dict(orient='records')
    else:
        recommended_products = []

    return render_template('recommendations.html', recommendations=recommended_products)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)

Step 3: Create HTML Templates

You need a few basic HTML templates for the pages. Create a folder named templates in the same directory as your script, and add the following files:

    home.html:

    html

<!doctype html>
<html>
<head><title>Home</title></head>
<body>
    <h1>Product List</h1>
    <ul>
        {% for product in products.to_dict(orient='records') %}
            <li><a href="{{ url_for('product', product_id=product['product_id']) }}">{{ product['name'] }}</a></li>
        {% endfor %}
    </ul>
</body>
</html>

product.html:

html

<!doctype html>
<html>
<head><title>{{ product['name'] }}</title></head>
<body>
    <h1>{{ product['name'] }}</h1>
    <p>Product ID: {{ product['product_id'] }}</p>
    <a href="{{ url_for('recommendations') }}">See Recommendations</a>
</body>
</html>

recommendations.html:

html

    <!doctype html>
    <html>
    <head><title>Recommendations</title></head>
    <body>
        <h1>Recommended Products</h1>
        <ul>
            {% for product in recommendations %}
                <li>{{ product['name'] }}</li>
            {% endfor %}
        </ul>
        <a href="{{ url_for('home') }}">Back to Home</a>
    </body>
    </html>

Explanation of the Code

    User Behavior Tracking: When a user views a product, their behavior is logged in a DataFrame. This is a placeholder; in a real application, you'd likely use a database.

    Product Recommendation: The recommendation system uses NearestNeighbors from scikit-learn to find similar products based on dummy features. You would replace the dummy features with real product attributes.

    Basic Routes: The Flask app has routes for the home page, product details, and recommendations.

Next Steps

    Enhance Data Collection: Implement real tracking of user behavior, possibly using cookies or user authentication.

    Improve Feature Representation: Use actual features for products (e.g., category, price, style) to enhance the recommendation logic.

    Deploy: Consider deploying your application using a platform like Heroku, AWS, or DigitalOcean.

    Integrate a Real ML Model: Train a model on historical user behavior data to improve recommendations.

This example provides a foundational structure for your e-commerce platform. Feel free to expand and modify it based on your specific needs!
